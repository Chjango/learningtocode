I had chjj sit down with me and teach me how to ride this thing. I debated whether to learn my first language in Go or in JavaScript. I ultimately settled on JavaScript, since that is the preferred language of my instructor, despite Tendermint and the SDK being written in Golang.

I defaulted to vim to write the script. Because fuck it.

After about an hour of coaching and lots of hand-holding, my brain was on fire, but I had a working script. The result was server.js.

Lesson For Beginners:
- Implement first, iterate in code, then write the spec. Else, if you write the spec first, then implement, you effectively have design-by-committee, and that leads to bikeshedding.
- Write tests as you're writing the code.
